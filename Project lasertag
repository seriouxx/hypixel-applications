# Project: Lasertag

## Objective

Develop a fast-paced, engaging game designed for use on KitPvP servers or in lobbies. The game is inspired by a laser tag arena at a local bowling alley, providing a unique gameplay experience.

## Overview

**Version:** 1.18.1  
**Tools:** Java, Maven, Spigot

**Lasertag** is a dynamic game where players are grouped into teams and compete for control of a central point. Instead of the traditional mechanic of players respawning upon death, this game introduces a "disable" mechanic, which temporarily removes players from active play. This allows for strategic repositioning rather than immediate respawning.

### Key Features

- **Player Kits:** Players can choose from 3 distinct kits, each offering unique abilities and playstyles.
- **Control Points:** Each team fights to control a central point with a health pool. As the control point’s health depletes through gameplay:
  - **Buffs and Nerfs:** Players receive buffs and nerfs based on the current health tier of their team’s control point.
- **Game Mechanics:** Instead of players dying and respawning immediately, they are "disabled" for a short period, adding a strategic layer to the game.

### Current Development

- Working on enabling the functionality for running multiple games simultaneously.
- Implementing a party system for better team management and coordination.
